# Online Store
OnlineStore is a web application developed to support online shopping. 
The project focuses on providing a user-friendly interface that allows customers to explore products, create orders, and manage them effortlessly.
## Key Features
- Products

  The OnlineStore showcases a wide range of products. Customers can conveniently view and sort products by name or price, enabling easy product discovery and comparison.
  

- User Management

  Customers can create accounts with email confirmation. They can manage their personal information and conveniently access their order history. The website also offers the flexibility to switch between English and Ukrainian languages.

- Order Management

  The OnlineStore provides a dedicated page listing all the user's orders. Customers can sort orders by creation date, price, or status (paid or unpaid). They have the ability to add new orders, edit existing ones, and delete orders if needed. The order page offers a comprehensive summary of the selected items, total cost calculation, and includes additional information like order descriptions and delivery addresses.
## Technology Stack

The OnlineStore project incorporates a range of technologies to deliver its functionality:

- Front-end: The user interface is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. These technologies enable responsive and visually appealing web pages.

- Back-end: The server-side logic is implemented using Java(17) and the Spring Framework(3.0.6). Spring's features, such as Spring Boot and Spring MVC, streamline development and facilitate efficient handling of web requests. JPA/Hibernate are employed for object-relational mapping and database access.

- Database: The project utilizes MySQL(8.0.14) as the relational database management system, ensuring reliable and structured data storage.
Other Technologies: Liquibase helps with database schema management and versioning. Thymeleaf, a Java-based server-side template engine, is employed for server-side rendering of dynamic web pages. AJAX is used to enable asynchronous communication with the server, enhancing the user experience. Docker and Docker Compose are used for containerization and orchestration, allowing for easy deployment and scalability.
